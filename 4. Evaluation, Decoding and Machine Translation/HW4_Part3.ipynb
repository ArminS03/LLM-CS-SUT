        "The beam search algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node in a limited set. It's like a breadth-first search that prunes away branches that are less likely to lead to the optimal solution. In the context of language models, it's a technique used to generate text where at each step, instead of considering all possible next tokens, only a specified number of the most probable next tokens (defined by the beam width `k`) are kept. This approach balances between the breadth of the search and computational efficiency, making it possible to generate more coherent and contextually appropriate sequences than a greedy search, which only considers the single best next token at each step.\n",

        "Through your experimentation, you might have noticed certain limitations in the plain beam search algorithm. To overcome these, we can integrate advanced techniques such as n-gram blocking and the Hamming diversity factor. Let’s explore these concepts in more detail and see how they can be applied to improve your beam search decoder.\n",

        "\n",
        "**What is n-gram blocking?**\n",
        "n-gram blocking is a technique used to prevent the model from generating the same sequence of tokens (an n-gram) more than once. An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of `n` tokens from the text. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\", \"the cat sat\" is a 3-gram.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why use n-gram blocking?**\n",
        "It helps mitigate the issue of repetitive loops in the generated text, a common problem where the model outputs the same phrase over and over again. By blocking previously generated n-grams, we force the model to explore new paths and produce more varied and unique sequences.\n",

        "#### Hamming Diversity Factor\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is the Hamming diversity factor?**\n",
        "The Hamming diversity factor is a technique that introduces diversity into the beam search by penalizing new sequences that are too similar to any existing sequence in the beam. The Hamming distance measures how many positions two sequences of the same length differ. The diversity factor applies a penalty based on this distance, encouraging the selection of more diverse sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why apply the Hamming diversity factor?**\n",
        "In beam search, there's a risk that all top `k` sequences may become very similar to each other, as they might all share a common prefix. This similarity can reduce the overall diversity of the generated text. By applying the Hamming diversity factor, we encourage the model to generate a set of diverse sequences, potentially covering a wider range of meanings and contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step by Step Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "- **n-gram Blocking**:\n",
        "   1. Implement a check within your beam search loop to ensure that no n-gram in the newly generated sequence is a repeat of any n-gram in the current beam.\n",
        "   2. You will need to maintain a list of all n-grams generated so far and prevent these from being considered in future steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hamming Diversity Factor**:\n",
        "   1. After generating all possible next step candidates but before selecting the top `k`, calculate the Hamming distance between each candidate sequence and all the sequences currently in the beam.\n",
        "   2. Apply a penalty to the scores of the candidate sequences based on their Hamming distance to the sequences in the beam. The penalty can be a simple multiplicative factor that decreases the score of a candidate sequence based on how similar it is to any sequence in the beam.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can use the beam search decoder function you've already completed as a starting point for this section. Integrate the n-gram blocking and Hamming diversity factor into the existing code.

        "### BLEU Metric\n",
        "\n",
        "The BLEU metric quantifies the similarity between a machine-generated translation and a set of high-quality reference translations. It does this by computing the precision of matched n-grams between the translations and references, applying a brevity penalty to prevent favoring overly short translations.\n",
        "\n",
        "As part of this exercise, you are expected to implement the `calculate_bleu_score` function. This function will take a list of predicted sentences and a list of reference sentences and return the BLEU score.\n",
        "\n",
        "To implement the BLEU metric, students should follow a step-by-step process that aligns with the mathematical foundations of the metric. The BLEU score calculation involves multiple components, each addressing a different aspect of the translation's quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step-by-Step Guide\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding BLEU**\n",
        "  - Start by understanding the BLEU score's components. The BLEU score evaluates the quality of machine-translated text against reference translations using n-gram precision and a brevity penalty.\n",
        "  - Read about the mathematical details in this [foundational blog post on BLEU](https://towardsdatascience.com/foundations-of-nlp-explained-bleu-score-and-wer-metrics-1a5ba06d812b).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Tokenization**\n",
        "  - Tokenize both the predicted sentences and the reference sentences. This means splitting each sentence into its constituent words or tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **N-gram Precision Calculation**\n",
        "  - For n-grams of sizes 1 to 4 (unigrams to 4-grams), calculate the precision. Precision is the ratio of the number of matching n-grams in the predicted text to the number of n-grams in the predicted text.\n",
        "  - Use the `ngrams` function from NLTK to generate n-grams from the sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Count Overlapping N-grams**\n",
        "  - For each n-gram size, count the number of n-grams in the predicted text that appear in the reference text. This count is capped by the maximum number of times each n-gram appears in the reference text (to avoid over-counting repeated n-grams).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Calculate Individual Precisions**\n",
        "  - Divide the count of overlapping n-grams by the total number of n-grams in the predicted text for each n-gram size. This gives you the precision for each n-gram size.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Compute Brevity Penalty**\n",
        "  - The brevity penalty penalizes overly short predicted texts. It's calculated as `exp(1 - r/c)` where `r` is the length of the reference text and `c` is the length of the predicted text. If the predicted text is longer than the reference, the brevity penalty is 1 (no penalty).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Calculate BLEU Score**\n",
        "  - The final BLEU score is the geometric mean of the four n-gram precisions, multiplied by the brevity penalty. Use the `math` library to calculate the geometric mean.\n",

        "To gain a deeper understanding of the T5 model's attention mechanisms, you should modify various parameters and observe the resulting changes in attention patterns. This analysis will reveal how the model allocates attention at different stages of processing and how each head within the layers may capture different types of information.\n",

        "<font color=\"green\"><b>\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How do attention patterns differ between the first and last layers of the model? What does this suggest about the role of initial versus deeper layers in processing the input?\n",
        "9. What variations do you observe in the attention patterns of different heads within the same layer? Can you hypothesize what different types of information each head might be capturing?\n",
        "10. How does the complexity or length of the input text influence the attention patterns? Do certain types of sentences result in more or less attention spread across the input tokens?\n",

        "\n",
        "<font color=\"red\">\n",
        "\n",
        "8. The initial layer in a transformer model attends to proximate dependencies and elemental linguistic features, prioritizing individual words and their immediate contextual relationships. In contrast, the final layer engages in synthesizing higher-level abstractions and capturing extended dependencies across the input sequence.\n",
        "9. Within a single layer, the distinct attention heads showcase visible patterns. Notably, in cross attention, there is an observable emphasis on punctuation marks, suggesting a heightened sensitivity to structural cues rather than individual words. Contrarily, in self-attention, a prevalent trend emerges where the initial word of the sentence garners a substantial share of attention, while other words primarily attend to their immediate vicinity. This highlights specialized roles within attention heads, with cross attention prioritizing structural elements and self-attention placing importance on both sentence initiation and local contextual relationships.\n",
        "10. The complexity of input text can influence attention patterns, with more complex sentences requiring attention to a wider range of linguistic features. Longer sentences may lead to more dispersed attention weights as heads specialize in attending to different sections of the input.\n",
