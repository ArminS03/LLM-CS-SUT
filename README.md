Fall 2023

1. LoRa and Adapters:
    - Exploring Full and Parameter Effecient fine-tuning of LLMs using Adapters and LoRa as well as Soft Prompting.

2. In-Context Learning:
    - Analysing the effects of In-Context Learning based on number and order of examples. Studying the effects of dataset and altering it to see the results on generalization.
    
3. Captioning and RAG:
    - Using LLM's as captioners by combining the embeddings of image and text. Studying the applications of Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model in retriving data and generating proper response.

4. Evaluation, Decoding and Machine Translation:
    - Comparing different decoding methods used in generating text with LLMs. Getting familiar with different evaluation methods for LLMs, and exploring their capabilities for machine translation.
